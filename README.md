# Korean Skin Care (KSC) Marketplace
# changes
## Overview
The Korean Skin Care (KSC) Marketplace is a two-way marketplace application for users to buy and sell Korean skin care products.

### Purpose and target audience
The Korean skin care regimen is well known for recommending the use of multiple products layered on top of each other. It is not uncommon for consumers of skin care products to purchase multiple items at a time. However, some of these items may end up being discarded before the product has been exhausted for various reasons:  

* Users have multiples of the same type of product and no longer wish to use them
* Allergic reactions
* Cosmetic issues where the user does not like the product's feel, fragrance or appearance on their skin
* Product is not suitable for purchaser's skin type

To reduce wastage, improve sustainability and minimize impact to the environment, KSC was developed to allow users of Korean skin care to sell their unwanted skin care. KSC will accept products that have not reached their expiry date, have not been opened, or have not been used more than half way. KSC is not intended for commercial use.

In the case where a product has already been opened and/or used, proof of purchase date in the form of a receipt must be supplied. This is to avoid the incidence of an expired product being sold.

## R18	Discuss the database relations to be implemented in your application  

My database will have 10 tables, consisting of:
 * 4 parent tables:  

    * categories - to categorise the products (e.g. cleanser, moisturiser).   

    * brands - each product will have a brand. I did not use manufacturer as the manufacturer name may differ from the brand name.  

    * ingredients - I chose to put the ingredients in their own table rather than incorporate them into the product table as the same ingredients are used in many products.  

    * users - this table will be generated by the gem Devise  

 * 4 child tables: 

    * products - this table will store the details of each product listing, and contain the brand_id as the foreign key. It will contain 1-2 images - 1 product image and 1 image of the purchase receipt for used products. I did not include the image columns in the product table as the images will use Rail's Active Storage functionality and therefore will not be stored in the database itself.  

    * orders - this table will record the order details and the total amount of the order. Although the total amount will be calculated based on the price of the items I am choosing to store it in its own field to hopefully retrieve this information easily on the purchase summary page that I will be implementing.  

    * user_infos: It was recommended that the users table generated by Devise not be modified as there has been difficulty retrieving information from user-generated fields via the controller. Therefore, I will be implementing a separate table to store the user information and administrator attribute to avoid potential issues. This table will have a one-to-one relationship with the Devise generated user table.  

    *  addresses: I will be storing each user's address in a separate table as one user may have more than one address (billing and postal), and a user may not have any addresses recorded until they wish to purchase or sell an item.  

 * 2 join tables:

    * product_ingredients: one product will have multiple ingredients, and the same ingredients are in many products.

   * order_lines: It is not ideal for the user to have to make one purchase at a time. To allow for multiple orders of multiple products to be processed in one transaction, I have included an order line table.


## R19	Provide your database schema design


## R20	Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project  

I am using Trello to break down the project into small tasks and to keep track of the progress of each task. I have assigned a due date for each task to ensure that I am able to complete the project within the allocated time frame. I will not deviate from the initial scope that I have planned, but anticipate that I have missed some items initially which are required to complete my application so will add them at a later stage if required.
